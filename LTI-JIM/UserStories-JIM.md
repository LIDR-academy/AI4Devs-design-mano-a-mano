### **Backlog Estimation Breakdown:**

- **High-Priority Stories:** These are foundational features, including job posting, scheduling, and AI matching, which provide high value and address core market needs. They’re essential for LTI to be competitive and are expected to require medium to high effort, with dependencies on external APIs and potential risks in testing integration.

- **Medium-Priority Stories:** Enhance user efficiency and engagement, such as candidate ranking insights and automated notifications. These can be developed in tandem with higher-priority items once dependencies are met.

- **Low-Priority Stories:** Features like enhanced user insights and real-time status tracking offer additional value but are not immediately essential. They can be introduced gradually to improve the overall experience.

This prioritization should ensure LTI meets core market requirements effectively while managing risks and dependencies.
