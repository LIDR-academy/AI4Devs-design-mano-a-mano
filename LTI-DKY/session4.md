### Prompt 1:
You are a good Product Manager and Business Analyst. 
I want to build the user stories and product backlog of a system with the following key functionalities:
1. **Candidate Sourcing & Management**:

   - Centralized dashboard for managing all candidates.
   - AI-powered candidate ranking and matching.
   - Customizable job listings that can be posted across multiple platforms (e.g., LinkedIn, Indeed).

2. **Automated Resume Screening**:

   - Automatic parsing and ranking of resumes based on job requirements.
   - Pre-screening questionnaires to filter out unqualified applicants.

3. **Interview Scheduling**:

   - Integrated scheduling tool with calendar syncing for real-time availability.
   - Automated interview reminders sent to candidates and interviewers.

4. **Collaboration & Communication Tools**:

   - Shared workspaces for recruiters and managers with real-time feedback on candidates.
   - Instant messaging to streamline internal communication.
   - Email and SMS integrations to maintain contact with candidates.

5. **Reporting & Analytics**:

   - Real-time analytics dashboards showing key recruitment metrics.
   - Custom reports for tracking diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) goals.
   - Time-to-hire, cost-per-hire, and applicant pipeline health metrics.

6. **AI-Powered Candidate Matching**:

   - AI algorithms to recommend top candidates based on job descriptions and company culture fit.
   - Predictive analytics for assessing candidate success likelihood in roles based on past hires.

7. **Onboarding Automation**:

   - Automated offer letter generation and digital signatures.
   - New hire documentation management.
   - Post-hire follow-up reminders for both HR and new employees.

8. **Compliance & Data Security**:
   - Built-in tools to manage GDPR, EEO, and other compliance requirements.
   - Secure candidate data storage with role-based access for HR teams.

Consider that I already have these two use cases:
### **Use Case 1: Automated Candidate Screening and Ranking**

**Description**: This use case focuses on the system automatically screening and ranking candidates based on the job requirements, using AI to filter out unqualified candidates and prioritize top applicants for the recruiterâ€™s review.

#### Actors:

- **Recruiter**: Reviews candidates shortlisted by the system.
- **ATS System (LTI)**: Automates screening and ranking.

#### Steps:

1. Recruiter posts a job description.
2. LTI parses resumes and compares them against job requirements.
3. LTI ranks candidates using AI algorithms.
4. LTI generates a shortlist for the recruiter.
5. Recruiter reviews the ranked list.

![Use Case 1: Automated Candidate Screening and Ranking](Use%20Case%201:%20Automated%20Candidate%20Screening%20and%20Ranking.png)

### **Use Case 2: Interview Scheduling and Management**

**Expanded Description**: LTI automates interview scheduling by integrating with external calendar services, syncing availability for both interviewers and candidates, proposing suitable times, and managing automated reminders. The system reduces the administrative workload on recruiters while ensuring candidates and interviewers are well-informed and on time for interviews.

#### Actors:

- **Recruiter**: Selects candidates and finalizes interview times.
- **Candidate**: Receives interview details and responds with their availability.
- **ATS System (LTI)**: Handles scheduling, calendar syncing, and reminders.
  - **Calendar Sync Module**: Syncs availability across different calendar services.
  - **Scheduler Engine**: Proposes optimal interview times based on availability.
  - **Notification System**: Sends reminders and confirmations to all parties.

#### Detailed Steps:

1. **Recruiter selects candidates** for interviews and initiates scheduling within LTI.
2. **Calendar Sync Module** pulls availability from recruiter and interviewer calendars (Google Calendar, Outlook, etc.).
3. **Scheduler Engine** checks candidate availability and proposes suitable interview times based on overlapping free time.
4. **LTI sends proposed interview times** to candidates for confirmation.
5. **Candidate confirms or requests reschedule**, which is processed by the Scheduler Engine.
6. **Scheduler Engine finalizes** the interview time, syncing calendars with the confirmed slot.
7. **Notification System sends automatic reminders** to both recruiters and candidates, leading up to the interview.
8. **Interviews are conducted**, and post-interview follow-ups or evaluations are scheduled as needed.
