These Epics and User Stories provide a foundation for building the LTI system, covering user management, job handling, application processing, interviews, feedback, and notifications. If you need more details on specific use cases or wish to prioritize the backlog, we can refine this further.

## Prompt 2 - Build the Product Backlog
Now, you have to consider that we are starting with a bandwith of 2 backends and 2 frontends. We are working by sprints of 2 weeks, prioritize and organize the different US in different sprints in order to deliver value and progress for each sprint closed.

## Response 2
Given the bandwidth of 2 backend developers and 2 frontend developers, and with each sprint lasting 2 weeks, we need to prioritize user stories that deliver early value and enable subsequent development. The goal is to incrementally build the LTI system, allowing for continuous testing and feedback. Here’s a proposed sprint plan for the initial sprints:
Sprint 1: Foundation Setup

    Goal: Establish the foundational elements of the system, including user authentication and basic job management.

These work tickets provide detailed tasks for developers to start implementing **US 3.2: Manage Job Applications**. Each task is broken down with clear requirements and technologies to use, making it ready for estimation in story points.

## Prompt 4 - Estimate the Effort
As a last step, it's time to estimate in story points each work ticket following Fibonacci methodology

## Response 4
Using the Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.) to estimate the complexity of each work ticket for **US 3.2: Manage Job Applications**, we will assign story points based on factors such as effort, complexity, and risk. Here are the estimates:

### Ticket Estimates:

1. **Backend API for Viewing Job Applications**
    - **Story Points:** 5
    - **Rationale:** Involves setting up the database queries, securing the endpoint, and handling pagination and filtering. Moderate complexity.

2. **Backend API for Updating Application Status**
    - **Story Points:** 3
    - **Rationale:** Updating a single field (status) is less complex, but requires handling validation, logging, and access control.

3. **Frontend UI for Viewing Job Applications**
    - **Story Points:** 5
    - **Rationale:** Building the UI with a table component, handling API integration, and managing loading/error states adds complexity.

4. **Frontend UI for Updating Application Status**
    - **Story Points:** 3
    - **Rationale:** Adding a status update action is simpler than creating the entire list view, but it requires user feedback handling.

5. **Backend Notification on Application Status Change**
    - **Story Points:** 8
    - **Rationale:** Involves implementing event-driven architecture with Kafka, sending notifications, and handling potential failures.

6. **Frontend UI for Viewing Detailed Job Application**
    - **Story Points:** 5
    - **Rationale:** Fetching detailed data and creating a user-friendly interface for displaying all the information adds moderate complexity.

7. **Backend Audit Logging for Application Changes**
    - **Story Points:** 3
    - **Rationale:** Involves creating a new table and adding logging functionality, which is relatively straightforward.

8. **Frontend Filtering and Sorting on Job Applications List**
    - **Story Points:** 5
    - **Rationale:** Requires integrating filtering and sorting with the backend and updating the UI dynamically, adding some complexity.

### Summary of Story Points
- **Ticket 1:** 5 points
- **Ticket 2:** 3 points
- **Ticket 3:** 5 points
- **Ticket 4:** 3 points
- **Ticket 5:** 8 points
- **Ticket 6:** 5 points
- **Ticket 7:** 3 points
- **Ticket 8:** 5 points

The total for **US 3.2: Manage Job Applications** is **37 story points**, making it suitable for multiple sprints. The higher-complexity tasks can be prioritized earlier, while less complex tasks can be handled in parallel.

## Prompt 5 - Fixing issues in the backlog organization
I see a problem. For the Sprint 3, we considered 3 US, 3.2, 6.1 and 4.1, but only with the work tickets of the US 3.2 we are exceeding the maximum capacity of our devs per sprint (8 story points per dev per sprint and we have 4 devs in total, so 32 story points)

## Response 5
To address the capacity issue for Sprint 3, we need to adjust the workload. We'll prioritize some tickets from **US 3.2** and defer others, while also considering the smaller tasks from **US 6.1** and **US 4.1**. Here’s a revised plan:

### Revised Sprint 3 Plan
- **Goal:** Implement core functionalities for managing job applications while starting work on notifications and interview scheduling.
- **Total Capacity:** 32 story points

#### Priority Work Tickets from US 3.2 (Total: 21 Points)
1. **Ticket 1:** Backend API for Viewing Job Applications – **5 points**
2. **Ticket 2:** Backend API for Updating Application Status – **3 points**
3. **Ticket 3:** Frontend UI for Viewing Job Applications – **5 points**
4. **Ticket 4:** Frontend UI for Updating Application Status – **3 points**
5. **Ticket 7:** Backend Audit Logging for Application Changes – **3 points**
6. **Ticket 8:** Frontend Filtering and Sorting on Job Applications List – **5 points** *(Move to Sprint 4)*

#### Work Tickets from Other User Stories
1. **US 6.1 – Automated Notifications** *(Partial Implementation)*
    - Implement basic notification triggering – **5 points**
2. **US 4.1 – Basic Interview Scheduling API** *(Initial implementation)*
    - Develop a simple API to schedule an interview without advanced options – **6 points**

### Revised Distribution
- **US 3.2 Tickets:** 21 points
- **US 6.1 Partial Implementation:** 5 points
- **US 4.1 Partial Implementation:** 6 points
- **Total:** 32 points

By implementing this approach, we stay within the sprint's capacity and still deliver value, while deferring some tasks to the next sprint.
