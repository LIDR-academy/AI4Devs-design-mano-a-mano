It visually represents the core containers of the system, such as the ATS Web Application, ATS API, Database, and external systems like Job Board API Integrations and the Notification Service. The arrows indicate how these containers interact with one another, as well as with external users like Recruiters/HR and Job Seekers. This diagram serves as a high-level architectural blueprint of the ATS system.
