Here are the three main use cases and detailed descriptions for the Applicant Tracking System (ATS). I'll also provide a complete diagram for each one using Mermaid code.

---

### **Use Case 1: Job Posting & Syndication**
#### **Description:**
Recruiters create job postings in the ATS and syndicate them to multiple job boards with one click. This use case includes creating job descriptions, selecting job boards, and tracking the status of the post.

#### **Steps:**
1. **Recruiter logs in** to the ATS.
2. **Recruiter creates a new job post**, entering job details like title, description, and requirements.
3. **Recruiter selects** multiple job boards (e.g., LinkedIn, Indeed).
4. **ATS syndicates the job** to the selected job boards.
5. **Recruiter tracks** job post status and views incoming applications.

#### **Diagram (Mermaid):**

  E --> F[Applicants submit resumes]
  F --> G[ATS stores applications for the recruiter]
```

---

### **Use Case 2: Candidate Screening and Shortlisting**
#### **Description:**
The ATS automates the initial screening of candidates based on predefined criteria, such as required skills or experience. Candidates are scored or ranked, and the recruiter can manually review and adjust shortlists.

#### **Steps:**
1. **ATS automatically scans** candidate resumes.
2. **ATS ranks candidates** based on predefined rules (e.g., years of experience, skills).
3. **Recruiter views the candidate ranking** and adjusts the shortlist as needed.
4. **Recruiter moves selected candidates** to the next stage in the hiring process.

#### **Diagram (Mermaid):**

  B --> C[Rank candidates by score]
  C --> D[Show ranked list to recruiter]
  D --> E[Recruiter adjusts shortlist]
  E --> F[Move selected candidates to next stage]
```

---

### **Use Case 3: Automated Interview Scheduling**
#### **Description:**
Once candidates pass the screening phase, the ATS handles scheduling interviews by integrating with calendar tools and offering candidate self-scheduling options.

#### **Steps:**
1. **Recruiter selects candidates** for interviews.
2. **ATS sends interview requests** to candidates via email.
3. **Candidates choose a time slot** based on recruiter availability.
4. **ATS schedules the interview**, syncing with the recruiter’s calendar.
5. **ATS sends reminders** to both the recruiter and the candidate.

## C4 Diagram

To design a **highly detailed C4 diagram** for the **DevOps Authentication Microservice** of your ATS platform, we’ll use **C4 Model’s 4 levels**: **Context, Container, Component, and Code**. This detailed approach allows us to model each layer of the authentication microservice while choosing the best modern technologies for scalability, security, and maintainability.

### **Level 1: Context Diagram**
Shows the authentication microservice's role in the overall system.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph ATS_System
        User[User (Recruiter/Manager)]
        WebApp[Web Application]
        MobileApp[Mobile Application (iOS/Android)]
        API_Gateway[API Gateway]
        AuthService[Auth Microservice]
        Backend[Backend Services]
    end

    User --> WebApp
    User --> MobileApp
    WebApp --> API_Gateway
    MobileApp --> API_Gateway
    API_Gateway --> AuthService
    API_Gateway --> Backend
    AuthService --> IdentityProvider[OAuth 2.0 Provider (e.g., Auth0)]
    AuthService --> Database[User DB (PostgreSQL)]
    AuthService --> Redis[Redis Cache (JWT Tokens)]
```

### **Technologies:**
- **Web App**: React.js, TypeScript
- **Mobile App**: React Native or Flutter
- **API Gateway**: Kong, NGINX with JWT Middleware
- **Auth Microservice**: Node.js/Express, Spring Boot (Java)
- **OAuth 2.0 Provider**: Auth0, Okta, AWS Cognito
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for user management
- **Caching**: Redis for token storage and session handling

---

### **Level 2: Container Diagram**
Explains how the different containers (applications and databases) interact inside the Auth microservice.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph AuthMicroservice
        API_Gateway2[API Gateway]
        AuthServer[Authentication Server]
        JWTService[JWT Issuer and Verifier]
        OAuthClient[OAuth2.0 Client]
        UserDB[PostgreSQL User DB]
        Redis2[Redis for Token Caching]
    end

    API_Gateway2 --> AuthServer
    AuthServer --> JWTService
    AuthServer --> OAuthClient
    AuthServer --> UserDB
    AuthServer --> Redis2
    JWTService --> Redis2
    OAuthClient --> OAuthProvider[Auth0/Okta/Cognito]
```

### **Technologies:**
- **API Gateway**: Kong Gateway or NGINX with JWT validation middleware.
- **AuthServer**: Node.js/Express with **Passport.js** for JWT OAuth 2.0 handling, or **Spring Boot** with **Spring Security**.
- **JWT Service**: **jsonwebtoken** (Node.js), or **jjwt** (Java) for token signing and verification.
- **OAuth Client**: **Passport.js** (Node.js) or **Spring Security OAuth2**.
- **User Database**: **PostgreSQL** for user storage (with encryption for sensitive data).
- **Redis**: For caching JWT tokens to reduce database load and ensure high-speed token validation.

---

### **Level 3: Component Diagram**
Detailed breakdown of the components within the **AuthService** container.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph AuthServerContainer
        AuthController[Auth Controller]
        UserService[User Service]
        TokenService[JWT Service]
        OAuthService[OAuth Client Service]
        Redis3[Redis Cache Service]
        DatabaseService[Database Service]
    end

    AuthController --> UserService
    AuthController --> TokenService
    AuthController --> OAuthService
    TokenService --> Redis3
    TokenService --> DatabaseService
    OAuthService --> OAuthProvider2[OAuth Provider (Auth0/Okta)]
    UserService --> DatabaseService
    Redis3 --> Redis3Cache[Redis]
    DatabaseService --> UserDB2[PostgreSQL]
```

### **Technologies:**
- **Auth Controller**: Routes HTTP requests for login, signup, token refresh, etc. **Express.js** (Node.js) or **Spring MVC** (Java).
- **User Service**: Manages user-related operations like registration, fetching user info. Uses **TypeORM** (Node.js) or **JPA/Hibernate** (Java).
- **Token Service**: Generates and verifies JWT tokens. **jsonwebtoken** (Node.js) or **jjwt** (Java).
- **OAuth Client Service**: Integrates with **OAuth 2.0** provider (e.g., Auth0, Okta) for authentication.
- **Redis Cache Service**: Manages token caching for quick verification.

---

### **Level 4: Code Diagram (Example)**

Here’s a breakdown of an example **JWT token generation process** in Node.js using Express and Passport.js.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant AuthController
    participant UserService
    participant JWTService
    participant RedisCache
    participant PostgreSQL
    participant OAuthProvider
    
    User->>+AuthController: Send login credentials
    AuthController->>+UserService: Validate user in PostgreSQL
    UserService->>+PostgreSQL: Query user credentials
    PostgreSQL-->>-UserService: Return user details
    UserService-->>-AuthController: Return user validation status
    AuthController->>+OAuthProvider: (Optional) Delegate to OAuth2 Provider
    OAuthProvider-->>-AuthController: Return OAuth tokens
    AuthController->>+JWTService: Generate JWT token
    JWTService->>+RedisCache: Cache token for fast retrieval
    JWTService-->>-AuthController: Return JWT token
    AuthController-->>-User: Send JWT token
```

### **Technologies:**
- **JWT Service**: **jsonwebtoken** (Node.js), Passport.js for middleware, or **jjwt** (Java).
- **Redis Cache**: Caches JWT tokens to reduce the load on the database. Used to blacklist tokens upon logout.

---

### **Conclusion:**

This detailed C4 diagram for the **Auth microservice** gives a clear view of the technologies used at each level, from the web/mobile clients down to the data storage layer. The solution uses **OAuth 2.0** for secure, scalable authentication, **JWT** for stateless session handling, and a combination of **PostgreSQL** and **Redis** for persistent user data storage and high-speed token management.

This architecture ensures the system is **scalable**, **secure**, and easy to maintain while providing support for future integrations with other third-party authentication services.
